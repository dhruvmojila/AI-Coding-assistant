# AI Coding Agent üöÄ  
**Revolutionizing Open Source Contributions: Your AI Coding Companion for Effortless Codebase Exploration.**

---

## üìñ Overview  
The **AI Coding Agent** is a powerful tool designed to simplify the process of understanding large codebases. By enabling users to interact with specific GitHub repositories through an intuitive chat interface, it empowers both open-source newcomers and professionals to save time and collaborate more effectively.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works  
This project is built on a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture:  

1. **Code Processing:**  
   - Extracts code from publicly available GitHub repositories.  
   - Converts code into embeddings and stores them in **Pinecone**, a high-performance vector database.  

2. **LLM Integration:**  
   - Leverages **Cerebras' inference API** for seamless and efficient access to a large language model (LLM).  

3. **User Interaction:**  
   - A user-friendly **Streamlit** interface allows users to query repositories, making code exploration highly intuitive and engaging.  

4. **Development Stack:**  
   - **Pinecone** for vector storage.  
   - **Cerebras** for LLM inference.  
   - **LangChain** for query chaining.  
   - **PyCharm** as the IDE for streamlined development.

## üåü Features  
- **Understand Any Codebase**: Explore and understand large codebases by simply chatting with the app.  
- **Open Source Ready**: Simplifies onboarding for open-source contributors.  
- **Fast and Scalable**: Powered by Cerebras‚Äô fast inference for real-time interaction.

## üöÄ Future Roadmap  
- **Dynamic Repository Support**: Enable users to add and interact with any GitHub repository dynamically.  
- **Enhanced Language Support**: Extend functionality to handle diverse programming languages effectively.  
- **Version Control Integration**: Add features to track changes across repository versions.  

Cerebras‚Äô inference API will continue to play a pivotal role in scaling the application and delivering lightning-fast responses as we expand the tool's reach.
